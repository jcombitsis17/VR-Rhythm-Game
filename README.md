C# Scripts for Unity VR Game


This was a two-person project in which we developed a VR video game using Unity and C# scripting. Our game was similar in style to the popular VR game Beat Saber, in which blocks move toward the player, who must make the correct gestures indicated on the blocks in sync with music.

Game design included creating and moving the blocks in sync with the music beats, detecting user input gestures from the game controller, parsing custom MIDI files for beat mapping, and audio analysis and visualization.

Our custom game controller was designed using an Arduino, which collected accelerometer data in real-time. The data was then transferred to Unity via Bluetooth, where it was used for gesture recognition.
